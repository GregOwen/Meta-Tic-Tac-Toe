These files create a game of meta tic-tac-toe.
GUI libraries used are available as stdlib.jar at http://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/

Rules:

Board:
The game board consists of a three-by-three grid of tic-tac-toe boards.

Winning:
The goal of the game is to win three of the tic-tac-toe boards in the same
row, column, or diagonal - a meta tic-tac-toe. Each individual tic-tac-toe
board is won by the usual rules of tic-tac-toe.

Play:
On the first move, a player may place a mark in any of the available slots. 
After the first move, however, players may only make marks in the
tic-tac-toe board whose position in the game board is the same as the
position in the smaller tic-tac-toe board of the previous player's mark.
For example, if the first player were to play in the top left corner of the
center tic-tac-toe board, the second player would have to place his or her
next mark in one of the slots of the top left tic-tac-toe board.
Note that it is perfectly legal (and, in some cases, a good strategy) to
send your opponent to a tic-tac-toe board that has already been won.
